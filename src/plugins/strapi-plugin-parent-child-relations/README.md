## Default Strapi vs Parent-Child Relationships Behavior

### Default Strapi Relationships Behavior

In Strapi by default, relationships between content types are managed using standard relation fields.
These allow you to link different content types but lack advanced features for managing hierarchical relationships such as parent-child structures

### Parent-Child Relationships Behavior

The **Parent-Child Relationships** plugin extends the default relationship capabilities in Strapi by providing a way to establish and manage hierarchical relationships between content types.
